  abstract = "The use of AI assistance in data annotation has made significant progress. However, qualitative coding in thematic analysis, as a specific
  type of annotation task, has unique characteristics that make effective human-AI collaboration difficult. Informed by a formative
  study, we designed PaTAT, a new AI-enabled tool that uses an interactive program synthesis approach to learn flexible and expressive
  patterns of user-annotated codes in real-time as users annotate the data. To accommodate the ambiguous, uncertain, and iterative
  nature of thematic analysis, the use of user-interpretable patterns allows users to understand and validate what the system has learned,
  make direct fixes, and easily revise, split, or merge previously annotated codes. This new approach also helps human users to learn data
  characteristics and form new theories in addition to facilitating the “learning” of the AI model. PaTAT’s usefulness and effectiveness
  were evaluated in a lab user study.",

  abstract = "Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) have led to significant improvement in natural
language interfaces for structured databases (NL2SQL). Despite the great strides, the overall accuracy of NL2SQL models is still far from
being perfect (∼75% on the Spider benchmark). In practice, this requires users to discern incorrect SQL queries generated by a model
and manually fix them when using NL2SQL models. Currently, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding about the common
errors in auto-generated SQLs and the effective strategies to recognize and fix such errors. To bridge the gap, we (1) performed an
in-depth analysis of errors made by three state-of-the-art NL2SQL models; (2) distilled a taxonomy of NL2SQL model errors; and
(3) conducted a within-subjects user study with 26 participants to investigate the effectiveness of three representative interactive
mechanisms for error discovery and repair in NL2SQL. Findings from this paper shed light on the design of future error discovery and
repair strategies for natural language interfaces for structured databases.",

In particular, existing datasets rarely distinguish fine-grained reading skills, such as the understanding of varying narrative elements. Drawing on the reading education research, we introduce FairytaleQA, a dataset focusing on narrative comprehension of kindergarten to eighth-grade students. Generated by educational experts based on an evidence-based theoretical framework, FairytaleQA consists of 10,580 explicit and implicit questions derived from 278 children-friendly stories, covering seven types of narrative elements or relations. Our dataset is valuable in two folds: First, we ran existing QA models on our dataset and confirmed that this annotation helps assess models{'} fine-grained learning skills. Second, the dataset supports question generation (QG) task in the education domain. Through benchmarking with QG models, we show that the QG model trained on FairytaleQA is capable of asking high-quality and more diverse questions.",

  abstract = {Despite its benefits for children’s skill development and parent-child bonding, many parents do not often engage in interactive storytelling by having story-related dialogues with their child due to limited availability or challenges in coming up with appropriate questions. While recent advances made AI generation of questions from stories possible, the fully-automated approach excludes parent involvement, disregards educational goals, and underoptimizes for child engagement. Informed by need-finding interviews and participatory design (PD) results, we developed StoryBuddy, an AI-enabled system for parents to create interactive storytelling experiences. StoryBuddy’s design highlighted the need for accommodating dynamic user needs between the desire for parent involvement and parent-child bonding and the goal of minimizing parent intervention when busy. The PD revealed varied assessment and educational goals of parents, which StoryBuddy addressed by supporting configuring question types and tracking child progress. A user study validated StoryBuddy’s usability and suggested design insights for future parent-AI collaboration systems.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, algorithms are used to make important decisions across society. However, these algorithms are usually poorly understood, which can reduce transparency and evoke negative emotions. In this research, we seek to learn design principles for explanation interfaces that communicate how decision-making algorithms work, in order to help organizations explain their decisions to stakeholders, or to support users' "right to explanation". We conducted an online experiment where 199 participants used different explanation interfaces to understand an algorithm for making university admissions decisions. We measured users' objective and self-reported understanding of the algorithm. Our results show that both interactive explanations and "white-box" explanations (i.e. that show the inner workings of an algorithm) can improve users' comprehension. Although the interactive approach is more effective at improving comprehension, it comes with a trade-off of taking more time. Surprisingly, we also find that users' trust in algorithmic decisions is not affected by the explanation interface or their level of comprehension of the algorithm.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
