      abstract="The Collaborative Qualitative Analysis (CQA) process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring multiple discussions among team members to refine codes and ideas before reaching a consensus. To address these challenges, we introduce CollabCoder, a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to support three CQA stages: independent open coding, iterative discussions, and the development of a final codebook. In the independent open coding phase, CollabCoder provides AI-generated code suggestions on demand, and allows users to record coding decision-making information (e.g. keywords and certainty) as support for the process.
During the discussion phase, CollabCoder helps to build mutual understanding and productive discussion by sharing coding decision-making information with the team. It also helps to quickly identify agreements and disagreements through quantitative metrics, in order to build a final consensus. During the code grouping phase, CollabCoder employs a top-down approach for primary code group recommendations, reducing the cognitive burden of generating the final codebook. An evaluation involving 16 users confirmed the usability and effectiveness of CollabCoder and offered empirical insights into the LLMs' roles in CQA.",
