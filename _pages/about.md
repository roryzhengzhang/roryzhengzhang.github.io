Hey! I'm a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.nd.edu/) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). My advisor is [Dr. Toby Jia-Jun Li](http://toby.li/). Before joining ND, I received two M.S degrees in Computer Science from the [University of Rochester](https://www.rochester.edu/) and the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), where I was advised by [Dr. Zhen Bai](https://zhenbai.io/) and [Dr. Haiyi Zhu](http://haiyizhu.com/) respectively. I received B.Eng in Software Engineering from [Shaanxi Normal University](https://www.snnu.edu.cn/).

My work falls in the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Program Synthesis**, and **Computer Vision**, where I use human-centered methods to design, build, and evaluate human-AI collaborative systems to strengthen the efficiency, trustworthiness, explanability, and accuracy of different phases in the AI model development and deployment, ranging from data annotation to model's decision making. Besides, I'm also passionate about leveraging the state-of-the-art AI techniques to benefit a variety of human needs and optimizing user experience accordingly.
